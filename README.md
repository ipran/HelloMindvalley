# HelloMindvalley
HelloMindValley is a demo app which uses the ImageCacheManager library for downloading image from server asynchronously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
****************************************** HOW TO USE IMAGECACHELIBRARY*************************************************

For downloading image data from url what we need to do only call the function, cacheImage(urlString: "image_url"). 
For example if I have an imageView, called myImageView, to display the image in that I just need to call:

myImageView.cacheImage(urlString: "image_url")

It will download the imagedata asynchronously.
